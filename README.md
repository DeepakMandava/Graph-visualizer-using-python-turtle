# Graph-visualizer-using-python-turtle
This is an user-interface where user can visualise a graph by adding nodes, edges and manuplating them i.e; can delete them. Also, user can perform BFS and DFS on his graph. There are no prior instructions needed to use this user-interface, here everything is very simply and straightforward


# Must remember points:
1. output related to DFS and BFS will only be shown in saved file(a .txt file is saved in corresponding folder when "save" button is clicked)
2. Inorder to avoid errors, please click save only after performing both BFS and DFS
3. User can find graph in the form of python-dictionary, BFS and DFS order in saved file named as "Graph" in same folder where codes were present
4. User will also get an image(.jpg format) which is screenshot of interface screen that shows graph picture

# Warning:
User system must consists of an text-editor or IDE which supports 
1. Python programming language
2. Turtle,
3. PIL(Python image library),
4. Tkinter, and 
5. Regular expression modules

The code is tested with python-3.9v and if anyone found errors, you are requested to get it to my attention
